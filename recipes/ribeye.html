    <h2>The Flatwoods Ribeye</h2>
    <p>A good ribeye steak is a luxury in any world. Whether you’re scraping by in a post‑nuclear Appalachia or just
        firing up
        the grill in your backyard, a thick-cut ribeye is still a promise of good eating. In the wasteland, you might
        sear it
        over a rusted mesh grate balanced on a trashcan fire. At home, you’ve probably got a stovetop that doesn’t
        require duct
        tape to stay level. Either way, the goal’s the same: a tender, smoky slab of meat that reminds you life can
        still taste
        damn good. So let’s cook one up—no radstorms, raiders, or deathclaws required.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye Steak - 12 to 16 Oz Cut</li>
        <li>Seasonings - Course salt and freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder</li>
        <li>Oil - A high smoke-point oil like avocado, canola, or vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Aromatics - A shallot, garlic cloves and fresh thyme.</li>
        <li>Butter - Baste the steak in melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season The Steak - Pat the steak dry with pepper towels and season liberally on both sides
            with the salt, pepper, and garlic.
        </li>
        <li>Head The Pan - Head a thing layer of oil in a large, thick-bottomed skillet
            over high heat until it starts to shimmer and lightly smoke.
        </li>
        <li>Sear The Steak - Carefully place the steak into the hot pan, reduce the heat slightly,
            and DO NOT TOUCH for a full minute. This allows a crust to form.
        </li>
        <li>Move And Flip - Gently move the steak freely around the pan for another full minute.
            Flip it to the other side and repeat the seat and the moving.
        </li>

    </ol>
