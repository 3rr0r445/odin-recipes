    <h2>The Flatwoods Ribeye</h2>
    <p>A good ribeye steak is a luxury in any world. Whether you’re scraping by in a post‑nuclear Appalachia or just
        firing up
        the grill in your backyard, a thick-cut ribeye is still a promise of good eating. In the wasteland, you might
        sear it
        over a rusted mesh grate balanced on a trashcan fire. At home, you’ve probably got a stovetop that doesn’t
        require duct
        tape to stay level. Either way, the goal’s the same: a tender, smoky slab of meat that reminds you life can
        still taste
        damn good. So let’s cook one up—no radstorms, raiders, or deathclaws required.</p>
